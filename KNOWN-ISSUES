KNOWN ISSUES

Some of the systray menus dont work yet. Still sorting them out.

The CleanUp tab list box background colour is hardly if at all readable if
   certain GTK dark themes are used. Currently no fix for this.

Resumes & Bittorrent feeds sometimes don't work
 - Python 2.4 is the cause of this issue.

CastPodder throws the error:
   "Another copy of CastPodder is running. Please raise it, wait for it to complete, or kill it."
   When CastPodder isn't even running.
       !!!NOTE!!! This happens if the user runs it as root or it crashes.
                  Delete the lockfile (ipodder.cfg.lock) in the ~/iPodderData directory.

Coralize does not always work. Please don't use it if you are having problems getting downloads with it.
