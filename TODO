TODO - Scott Grayban <sgrayban@castpodder.net>

 * (FIXED)Figure out why CastPodder throws the error:
   "Another copy of iPodder is running. Please raise it, wait for it to complete, or kill it."
   When iPodder isn't even running.
       !!!NOTE!!! This happens if the user runs it as root or it crashes.
                  Delete the lockfile in the ~/iPodderData directory.

 * (FIXED)Still need to write in a command line function so that users can use any
   player they wish and remove the built-in player functions.

 * (FIXED)Need to fix the tray icon to detect desktop gui's that don't support it.
   either by allowing the user to hide it or disable it.

-----
We added XMMS support but my goal is to make a preference setting
 that will let the linux user choose any player they want and let iPodder
 output the path to where the file is.
-----

 * (FIXED)Need to add mplayer(maybe???) to the list of players for the linux platform.
   - gmplayer /path/to/podcast-file
   - gmplayer -playlist /path/to/podcast-playlist

 * (FIXED)Need to add "Hide window" in the tray icon menu

 * (FIXED)Need to allow double click on tray icon to also hide window
   - right now it only opens the hidden window

 * (FIXED)Need to fix the error "Can't determine free disk space."
   - disk space can be determined by quota, du and/or df.

   Example of df output:
   # df `pwd`
   Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
   /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part7
                          14G   13G  1.4G  91% /home

   Example of quota output:
   Disk quotas for user sgrayban (uid 501): none
   
   Example of du output:
   # du -shc ~/iPodderData/
   144K    /home/sgrayban/iPodderData/
   144K    total
