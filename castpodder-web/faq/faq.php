      <strong><a name="1" id="1"></a>What is CastPodder? What can I use it for? </strong><br />  
      <br />
      CastPodder is technically a &quot;Media Aggregator,&quot; a program that allows you to select and download audio files from anywhere on the Internet to your desktop. <br />  
      <br />
      CastPodder makes the process easy by helping you select audio files from among the thousands of audio sources on the web and downloading those files to your computer. Once you select a feed or location, it will download those files automatically at times you specify and have the files waiting for you on your computer, so you don't have to spend a lot of time manually selecting and waiting for downloads. You can play your selected audio files using iTunes or other &quot;jukebox&quot; software, or load them on to your iPod or other portable digital media player to play anytime you want. <br />  
      <br />
      <strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>How does CastPodder work? </strong><br />  
      <br />
      CastPodder uses RSS (really simple syndication) to &quot;feed&quot; files to <br />
      your computer. RSS usually involves headlines and text, but we've devised a way to have it move audio files. Once you've installed CastPodder, you can select podcasts to subscribe to in two different ways: Either clicking the selection button to see a directory of available podcasts or enter a URL for a podcast you've found on your own. You can set the scheduling options so that CastPodder scans for new downloads as often as you like, or you can control it manually. When it is done downloading new files, it adds them to your library, all ready to be played or synched to your MP3 device. <br />  
      <strong><br />
      <a name="3" id="3"></a>Do I need an iPod to use CastPodder? </strong><br />  
      <br />
      No, you can use your computer or any other MP3 player. CastPodder is <br />
      platform-independent, so you can use it from virtually any computer and play the files on any MP3 device. <br />  
      <br />
      <strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>What systems does CastPodder run on? </strong><br />  
      <br />
      CastPodder runs on Linux only.<br />  
      <br />
      <strong><a name="5" id="5"></a>What are podcasts? </strong><br />  
      <br />
      Podcasts are audio broadcasts created and stored digitally on the Internet. Instead of being broadcast over the airwaves once and lost, like with traditional radio, podcasts were created to be stored and played at the user's convenience. Think of them as radio shows waiting to be downloaded. There are currently thousands of podcasts available covering everything from automobiles to rock 'n roll. <br />  
      <br />
      <strong><a name="6" id="6"></a>Can I make podcasts with CastPodder? How do I create a podcast?</strong> <br />  
      <br />
      The CastPodder software doesn't create podcasts, but there are many good sources on the web to guide you. Try: http://www.engadget.com/entry/5843952395227141/ <br />  
      <br />
      <strong><a name="7" id="7"></a>Where do I find podcasts?</strong> <br />  
      <br />
      Podcasts are all over the web and currently number in the tens of thousands. We've made it easy, though. We have created an index located in the Directory tab (at the top of CastPodder application) to get you started. Of course, you can also check out other directories published on the web as well. <br />  
      <br />
      <strong><a name="8" id="8"></a>Can I download music with CastPodder? </strong><br />  
      <br />
      Music can be part of a podcast, but CastPodder can not search p2p (peer-to-peer) networks such as Gnutella for music. <br />  
      <br />
      <strong><a name="9" id="9"></a>Why should I donate to the CastPodder team? </strong><br />  
      <br />
      We have spent some time creating this software which we offer for free and if you would like to donate to help our team, we would appreciate it. Please go <a href="/donation.php">here</a> to donate. It's good karma, and great things will happen to you the rest of your life if you donate. :) <br />  
      <br />
      <strong><a name="10" id="10"></a>Why is CastPodder free? </strong><br />  
      <br />
      CastPodder is free because we want to allow open access to this new network. We feel this new way of getting content should be available for everyone, not controlled by commercial interests. Our software is "free software," part of the new paradigm of sharing across the Internet, and licensed under the GPL. If our  code is used by other people in their software, their code also becomes open. A   viral effect!<br />  
      <br />
      <strong><a name="11" id="11"></a>Why do you use a guy fishing as logo? </strong><br />  
      <br />
      Since you asked .... it represents podcasts getting retieved from anyplace you wish. The idea is that CastPodder downloads &quot;fresh casting content.&quot; It's a refreshing way of accessing and downloading from the internet by simply pressing a button.<br />
      <br />
      <strong><a name="12" id="12"></a>What is a mirror?  I just want to download the software!</strong><br />  
      <br />
      "Mirror" is techie talk for places that hold identical copies of the program.  In theory, you'll get the fastest download if you pick the mirror that is geographically closest to you.  Other than that, you can pick any mirror and will get the same software.<br />
      <br />
      To select one, click on the icon with the 1s and 0s, directly to the left of number of bytes, in the Download column at the right side of the page.
