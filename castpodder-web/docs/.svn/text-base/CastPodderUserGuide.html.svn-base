will tell CastPodder to check all the Podcast feeds you have listed
(subscribed), for new Podcast Episodes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2)&quot;Catch-up&quot;.
Clicking the second button tells CastPodder to only download the last
new episodes from the Podcast feeds you have subscribed to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This is called
&quot;Catch-up&quot; and a pop-up window will ask you whether you
want to skip other (previously available, not the latest) episodes
you have not downloaded yet permanently or just this once. This will
force Catch-up to perform as you prescribed from then on. (You can
change this setting at a later time by going to the File /
Preferences / General Tab).</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">4)&quot;Remove selected
feed&quot; is the fourth button from the left (one with the red
circle / white x) and it will banish the Feed from your
Subscriptions. This means CastPodder will not be able to check that
Podcast for content again, unless you subscribe to it again! It is
important to notice that clicking on an Episode in the lower list and
then on the &quot;Remove selected feed&quot; button will delete the
Entire Feed and not that particular Episode. You can automatically
delete Episodes which are older than any given count of days using
the next button (Properties).</P>

number of days CastPodder will wait before deleting old Episodes from
that Podcast.</P>

you one-click access to the CastPodder Scheduler</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scheduler gives
users a variety of options for setting CastPodder to automatically
check Feeds for new content and download them, at set times or
regular intervals. This means you can either tell CastPodder to check
for new content at 3 different times during a 24 hour period, or you
can set it to check every so on, with options ranging from every 30
minutes to every 12 hours. If you would like to play Podcast shows
right after Scheduler has downloaded them, check the available option
at File / Preferences... / General Tab.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  The licenses for most

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  When we speak of free

Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">this service if you

you can change the software or use pieces of it</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  To protect your
rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">anyone to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</P>

the software, or if you modify it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  For example, if you
distribute copies of such a program, whether</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">gratis or for a fee,
you must give the recipients all the rights that</P>

make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">source code.  And you
must show them these terms so they know their</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  We protect your

avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</P>

considered independent and separate works in</P>

License, and its terms, do not apply to those</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sections when you
distribute them as separate works.  But when you</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based</P>

intent of this section to claim rights or contest</P>

third party, for a charge no more than your</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete</P>

the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</P>

for software interchange; or,</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    c) Accompany it
with the information you received as to the offer</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    to distribute
corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    allowed only for
noncommercial distribution and only if you</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    received the

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    an offer, in accord
with Subsection b above.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The source code for a
work means the preferred form of the work for</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">control compilation and

source code distributed need not include</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary</P>

components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</P>

which the executable runs, unless that component</P>

executable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If distribution of
executable or object code is made by offering</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">access to copy from a

source along with the object code.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  4. You may not copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</P>

provided under this License.  Any attempt</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">otherwise to copy,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under</P>

compliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  5. You are not
required to accept this License, since you have not</P>

nothing else grants you permission to modify or</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">distribute the Program

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">modifying or
distributing the Program (or any work based on the</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  6. Each time you
redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</P>

automatically receives a license from the</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">these terms and
