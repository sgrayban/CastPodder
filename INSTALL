---------------------------
Linux Install:
read the README first !!

1) su(do) to root
2) run ./install.sh
3) Place a shortcut on your desktop with /usr/bin/CastPodder as the binary executable.
4) For a desktop icon use the CastPodder.png in /opt/CastPodder

*** NOTE ***
This version supports XMMS for the player.
You _must_ have the xmms python libraries installed for this to work.


Enjoy !

Scott
